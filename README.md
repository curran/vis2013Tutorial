Material I presented at IEEE Vis 2013 in a tutorial called "Mobile and cloud Web-based graphics and visualization". [Check it out!](http://curran.github.io/vis2013Tutorial/)

The slides presented by Haim Levkowitz are available [here](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~haim/downLoad/web-cg-viz/web-cg-viz/presentations/PDF-2013-07/).

The presentation is a Web page styled to look like the [IEEE Vis PowerPoint template](http://www.ieeevis.org/year/2013/info/presenter-information/authors). Sections are authored in Markdown and parsed at runtime.
